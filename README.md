A website makeover project for RJCSD.org 

This repository is focused on a makeover of the [Racial Justice Coalition of San Diego](http://rjcsd.org) website so that they, a coalition of like-minded organizations, can more effectively address local policing practices.

We are seeking UX/UI, designers, and front end coders to work with our partner non-profit to develop and deploy an action plan.
